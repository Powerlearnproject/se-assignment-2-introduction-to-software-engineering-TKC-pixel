# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software Development is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software which involves applying engineering principles to ensure the software is reliable and efficient.

Traditional Programming is a process that mainly focuses on writing code to solve specific problems and it's different from Software Development as it doesn't manage a software project from start to finish.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.


Planning: Define the scope, resources, and timeline of the project.
Analysis: Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand their needs.
Design: Create architecture and design plans for the software.
Implementation: Write and compile the code according to the design specifications.
Testing: Verify that the software works as intended and fix any bugs.
Deployment: Release the software to users.
Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile Model:
Iterative and Incremental
Flexibility
Continuous Feedback
Collaboration
Customer Involvement

Waterfall Model:
Sequential Process
Clear Structure
Predictability
Less Flexibility

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle

Requirements Engineering is  the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements of the software.

Importance of Requirements Engineering in the software development lifecycle
Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
Analysis: Refining and prioritizing requirements.
Specification: Documenting the requirements clearly and precisely.
Validation: Ensuring the requirements meet stakeholders' needs.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to dividing a software system into separate, interchangeable components, each with a specific function.

It improves maintainability and scalability of software systems by:
Maintainable: Easier to update and fix parts of the system without affecting the whole.
Scalable: Simpler to add new features or expand the system by adding modules.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions.
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules or services work together.
System Testing: Verifies the complete and integrated software meets requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Validates the software works for the user and meets their needs.

Testing crucial in software development because it ensures the software is reliable, functional, and free of critical bugs, which is essential for user satisfaction and trust.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems track changes to code over time, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

They are important in Software Development bacause they help developers to Collaborate and help with history tracking.
Examples:
Git: Distributed VCS known for its speed and branching capabilities.
SVN (Subversion): Centralized VCS that is easy to use and maintain.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A Software Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Responsibilities:
Resource Management
Timeline Management
Risk Management

Challenges:
Balancing scope, time, and budget constraints while meeting stakeholder's expectations.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software Maintenance involves updating and improving software after its initial release.

Types of maintenance activities:
Corrective: Fixing bugs and errors.
Adaptive: Updating the software to work in new environments.
Perfective: Enhancing performance or adding new features.
Preventive: Making changes to prevent future issues.


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Privacy Concerns: Handling user data responsibly.
Security: Ensuring the software is secure from breaches.
Intellectual Property: Respecting copyrights and licenses.
